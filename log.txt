PART 1

Tasks: 
Created the new repository and imported the master repository.
Cloned the repository locally. 
Wrote the functions for the variable src file.
Wrote the first two functions for the function src file.
Also read on the discussion boards, did some work with, poked around in scratch pad,
tried a few different automatic script runners online; set up the repository and then
finally cloned it to my own computer. Installed GitHub for Windows. Got frustrated 
working with Linter online, which complained about everything. Most of the work here 
wasn't actually coding. Was also doing laundry, dishes, cleaning - hm, actual work 
time here was probably three hours.  

Start: Sat 24 Jan 2015 16:30:00 -0600 (ESTIMATE - I didn't commit anything when I sat back 
down)
End: Sat 24 Jan 2015 18:29:23 -0600
Tasks: Wrote the last function for the variable src file. Read about slice function, 
encountered some major problems because I overlooked the fact that the date should 
be stored as a data object, not just as a string. 

Start: Sun 25 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0600 (ESTIMATE, but it was very close to midnight)
End: Sun 25 Jan 4:15:33 2015 -0600 
Tasks: Wrote and error tested the code for objects.js. This was probably about one 
and a half hours. Then I style checked - installed Python 2.7, got Linter up and running. 
This took a long time. Went off on some tangents with some old python programs. 
Actual work time here was probably three or so hours.

**
I'd say my total work time for this portion of the assignment, counting necessary
background reading (like learning about slice) and counting helpful discussion board
forays, but not counting extraneous work, was 8-9 hours.

PART 2

Start: Fri 30 Jan 2015 16:30:00 -0600 
End: Fri Jan 30 18:34:55 2015 -0600 
Tasks: Setting up a form that receives response from GitHub

Start: Sat 31 Jan 2015 06:00:00 -0600 
End:  Sat Jan 31 09:10:44 2015 -0600
Tasks: Created div to show search results, and created functions and html for filtering
searches. Lots of work trying to access languages of the api files. 

Start: Sat 31 Jan 2015 17:00:00 -0600 
End:  Sat Jan 31 17:55:04 2015 -0600
Tasks: At last I am able to search through the languages of each file for each gist and
eliminate the entries we don't want

Start: Sat Jan 31 2015 18:15:00 -0600 
End:  Sat Jan 31 20:26:58 2015 -0600
Tasks: Separate function to test the langauge of each file in each gist

Start: Sun Feb 1 09:00:00 2015 -0600  
End: Sun Feb 1 16:45:26 2015 -0600
Tasks: Most of this time spent getting the results to actually display, getting them 
to be removable  and movable to the appropriate area (from search results to favorites)

Start: Sun Feb 1 17:30:00 2015 -0600  
End: Mon Feb 2 00:46:09 2015 -0600

Tasks: Huge task with getting the correct amount of results to display once I realized
that I needed successive HttpXML requests and found that the lag in the response was
causing my program to get ahead of itself - so that I was printing out an empty array,
since the response had not come back yet. Got the elimination of results already in 
favorites to work and local storage for favorites to work. Got printGists function
to work for multiple purposes, as originally intended in my initial design. Then 
spent commented my code and elimianted the errors discovered by lint.
